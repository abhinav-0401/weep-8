-- WEEP-8 DESCRIPTION --

NOTE: WEEP-8 is a (not so good) clone of CHIP-8, so the specification of WEEP-8 doubles as a specification for CHIP-8

1. 8-bit registers -> 16:
    var registers [16]int8

    => labeled v0 to vf.
    => each register is able to hold any value from 0x00 to 0xff.
    => register vf is special, used as a flag to hold info about operations.

2. 4k bytes of memory
    var mem [4096]int8

    => holding program instructions, long-term and short-term data.
    => 0x000 to 0xfff

    The address space is segmented into 3 sections:
    i. 0x000 to 0x1ff -> originally reserved for the chip8 interpreter, we simply will not use it, except for:
    ii. 0x050 to 0x0a0 -> used for storing the 16 chars (0 to f)
    iii. 0x200 to 0xfff -> instructions

3. 16-bit index register to store the memory addresses for use in operations:
    var index uint16
    => it's 16 bits because the maximum memory address(0xfff) won't fit in an 8-bit register

4. 16-bit program counter: 
    var pc uint16
    => to store the address of the next instruction to execute.
    => we generally read two bytes at once, because an instruction is generally two bytes.
    => thus after reading an instruction, the pc is generally incremented by 2.

5. 16 level stack:
    var stack [16]uint16
    => this is to keep the PCs of the times a call instruction is executed

6. 8-bit stack pointer:
    var stackPtr int8
    => keeps track of where we are in the stack[modeled using an array].

7. 8-bit delay timer: u8

8. 8-bit sound timer: u8

9. 16 input keys:
    Keypad       Keyboard
    +-+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+-+
    |1|2|3|C|    |1|2|3|4|
    +-+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+-+
    |4|5|6|D|    |Q|W|E|R|
    +-+-+-+-+ => +-+-+-+-+
    |7|8|9|E|    |A|S|D|F|
    +-+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+-+
    |A|0|B|F|    |Z|X|C|V|
    +-+-+-+-+    +-+-+-+-+

10. 64x32 Monochrome Display Memory:
    => additional memory buffer for storing the graphics to display.
    => 64 pixels wide and 32 pixels high
    => each pixel is either on or off: this can be encapsulated by a bit??

11. Weep-8 also has an 8-bit random number generator
